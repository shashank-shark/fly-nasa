## Failures of Wires and Connectors

A large percentage of trouble-shooting results from problems related to wires and connector failures. Provisions in avionics and vehicle design are essential to control and mitigate the hazards from these potential failures. Avionics systems must build in high reliability into electronics and conduct extensive analysis and test to increase the reliability cables, connectors, and sensors.

## Direct Costs

Measurement justification, design and implementation, structural provisions, inspection, test, retest after avionics r&r, logistics, vendor availability, etc. Every system team participates in the process of justifying sensors/data from the early design cycle through to the end of vehicle life.

## The Price of Copper

Six times the price it was in 2002, the price of copper has to be a factor in economics of providing connectivity.

## Cost of Change / Inflexibility

Changes are typically needed as the vehicle life-cycle progresses and missions are flown and experience is gained and problems are found. Instrumentation needs to be easily adaptable to these changing conditions.

## Cost of late Changes

Cost of change grows enormously as each flight grows closer, as the infrastructure grows more entrenched, as more flights are “lined-up” the cost of delays no matter what the reason grows exponentially and trouble-shooting and re-wiring cabling issues can sometimes be the cause.

## Cost of Data Not Obtained

Performance, analyses, safety, operations restrictions, environments and model validations, system modifications and upgrades, troubleshooting, end of life certification and extension. The data acquisition systems have been typically centralized, limiting the number of channels and unique specifications available

## Cost of Vehicle Resources

Resources needed to accommodate the connectivity or lack of measurements come in the form of weight, volume, power, etc.  Cable length and number of connectors are often not used as important metrics in assessing changes that involve new measurements or other changes.  It is the job of the instrumentation team to minimize these, but haven’t  had the luxury of alternatives to cables up till now.

## Cost of Flexibility of Vehicle Design

Cabling connectivity has little design flexibility and upgrades for avionics, sensors and cables are difficult. Robustness of wireless interconnects can match the need for functionality and level of criticality or hazard control appropriate for each application, including the provisions in structural design and use of materials.  The result is that the requested data is often not available when it is needed because of cost, and the lead time required for nominal or late requests.

## Performance

Weight is not just the weight of the cables, it is insulation, bundles, brackets, connectors, bulkheads, cable trays, structural attachment and reinforcement, and of course the resulting impact on payloads/operations. Upgrading various systems is more difficult with cabled systems. EMI/EMC and channel noise is always a consideration when running wires.

## Physical Restrications

Design and operations can make it impossible or impractical to use cabled connectivity for monitoring. Structural barriers can limit personnel access and connections to vehicle resources(like power and data). In-situ assembly and deployment of un-powered vehicle components can preclude wired connectivity. Other physical circumstances that drive the need for wireless communications for vehicles include operations performed by crew members, robots and robotic mechisms, proximity monitoring at launch, landing or mission operations.
