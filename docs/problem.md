# What's the problem ?

Aerospace vehicle programs have always counted on the cables and connectors to  provide power, grounding, data and time synchronization throughout a vehicleâ€™s life-cycle. Even with numerous improvements, wiring and connector problems and sensors continue to be key failure points, causing many hours of troubleshooting and replacement.

Costly flight delays have been precipitated by the need to troubleshoot cables/connections, and/or repair a sensor.

Wiring continues to be too expensive to remove once it is installed, even with the weight penalties. Miles of test instrumentation and low flight sensor wires still plague the aerospace industry.

The project motivates the aerospace industry and technology providers to establish:

#### A new emphasis for system engineering approaches to reduce cables and connectors.

#### Provisions for modularity and accessibility in the vehicle architecture.

#### A set of technologies that support alternatives to wired connectivity.
